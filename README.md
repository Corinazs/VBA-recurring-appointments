We have many recurring deadlines that are always due on the same working days or calendar days. Due to the lack of a function 
in Outlook to take into account weekdays and public holidays, it can happen that when we set general recurring deadlines, 
they fall on the exact days mentioned (e.g. 1.1.2022 is a Saturday). This can leed to missing deadlines, because we aren't working on saturdays. 
This user form shifts the set appointments to the Friday before or the Monday after. 
If the setting "relevant is the calendar day" is collected, then the appointment is moved to the last working day before the deadline (e.g. you always have a deadline on the 10th). 
Otherwise (for working days, e.g. a task is always due on the first working day), the deadline is moved to the first working day of the coming week.
Note that there is one exception: Deadlines on the last business day is also always moved to the last working days of the current week 
(no distinction is made here between working day and calendar day).
